      <head>Historical or Biographical Note</head>
      <p>The Student Employment office is now called Human Resources, is under the Assistant University Librarian for Administration, Development, and Personnel. The office oversees both graded and wage hour employees, including students. Its mission is to promote a work environment characterized by fair and equitable treatment of staff, effective recruitment, quality customer care, personal acceptability, trust and mutual respect. </p>
      <p>The George Washington University's (GW) Melvin Gelman Library opened in 1973. Before the Gelman Library (which received its current name in 1980), the University Library was located in Lisner Hall, formerly Lisner Library. When the University moved to Foggy Bottom in 1912 from its location on 15th and H Streets, N.W., the first library was located in the original Lisner Hall, the former St. Rose's School for Orphaned Girls, between 20th and 21st Streets on G Street. Other libraries include the Virginia Campus Library (established in 1990), and the Mount Vernon Campus Eckles Library (under GW control since 1997). Together, these three libraries form the Gelman Library System (GLS). </p>
      <p>The Library is headed by a University Librarian, who oversees: the Assistant University Librarian for Administration, Development, and Personnel; Associate University Librarian for Collections Services; Associate University Librarian for Information Technology; Associate University Librarian for Public Services; Directors of the Mt. Vernon and Virginia Campus libraries, and the Manager of GLS Financial Operations. </p>
