            <p>Burgiss Allison, a Trustee of Columbian College from 1821-26, was born in Bordentown, New Jersey on August 17, 1753. A clergyman by profession, he became a convert to the Baptist faith early in life and began to preach when he was sixteen years old. He studied at Rhode Island College (now Brown University) but did not graduate, but was awarded an honorary degree from Brown in 1804. He had charge of a small congregation in Bordentown where he established a classical boarding school which attained a great reputation. In 1796 he withdrew from his teaching and devoted several years to inventing. Improvements to the steam engine and its application to navigation resulted from his efforts. In 1801 he resumed his school and his pastorate, but ill health forced him to relinquish both. Rev. Allison was elected chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1816 and later became chaplain at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. He was also one of the secretaries of the American Philosophical Society for several years, helped found the American Academy of Fine Arts, and was vice president of the Baptist convention. Rev. Allison's daughter married Col. James Lewis Edwards, and Virginia Edwards Parker (the late wife of John E. Parker) is a direct descendent of this couple. Rev. Allison died in Washington on February 20, 1827. Materials include Rev. Allison's pair of spectacles with case. In the Gilbert Stuart portrait, he is holding them in his left hand. Spectacles in good condition, red case in poor condition. Also, included is the "Program for the Acceptance of the Gilbert Stuart Portrait of Burgiss Allison". Formerly ACC#961.</p>

            <p>Burgiss Allison, a Trustee of Columbian College from 1821-26, was born in Bordentown, New Jersey on August 17, 1753. A clergyman by profession, he became a convert to the Baptist faith early in life and began to preach when he was sixteen years old. He studied at Rhode Island College (now Brown University) but did not graduate, but was awarded an honorary degree from Brown in 1804. He had charge of a small congregation in Bordentown where he established a classical boarding school which attained a great reputation. In 1796 he withdrew from his teaching and devoted several years to inventing. Improvements to the steam engine and its application to navigation resulted from his efforts. In 1801 he resumed his school and his pastorate, but ill health forced him to relinquish both. Rev. Allison was elected chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1816 and later became chaplain at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. He was also one of the secretaries of the American Philosophical Society for several years, helped found the American Academy of Fine Arts, and was vice president of the Baptist convention. Rev. Allison's daughter married Col. James Lewis Edwards, and Virginia Edwards Parker (the late wife of John E. Parker) is a direct descendent of this couple. Rev. Allison died in Washington on February 20, 1827. Materials include a manuscript notebook in Reverend Burgiss Allison's hand: "Medical recipies collected by Burgiss Allison at different periods since Anno Domini 1793--." It includes a table of contents and forty-six recipes for treating ailments from asthma to whooping cough. Page 11 has a cough syrup recipe by Dr. J(ames) M. Staughton, son of Columbian College's first president William Staughton, and first professor of medicine at the college. Formerly ACC#961.</p>

            <p>This letter is about the first year of the Columbian College.  Chase was one of the original faculty members.  Having just recovered from a "severe attack of fever," he tells Rev. Williams that "The college here prospers beyond the most sanguine expectations. The whole number of students already amounts to nearly fifty. The policy which I have deemed it a duty to pursue, has been to introduce as early as possible such habits of order and industry as shall not need to be changed and to endeavour by every means in our power, to make an education here as sound and as extensive as at any college in the Union."  Chase goes on to explain about the school's public worship, notes establishment of a Sunday school and ends with a discussion of an upcoming "General Convention" and of having met a young man named Ludlow of New York.  Chase went on to help found Andover Newton Theological School.</p>
