      <head>Historical or Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Jack Northman Anderson (1922-2005) was an investigative journalist, author, television personality, and for over 50 years the columnist behind the syndicated column "Washington Merry-Go-Round." </p>
      <p>Anderson was born in Long Beach, CA on October 19, 1922, to Orlando and Agnes Mortensen Anderson, devout Mormons who moved the family to Utah when Jack was two years old. (Many sources, including the New York Times obituary, identify him as Jackson Northman Anderson, but this is incorrect; his given name was Jack.) He was a precocious journalist in small-town Utah. At 12 years old, he began writing the Boy Scout column for local newspaper The Deseret News, and soon graduated to covering local news for The Murray Eagle newspaper. In high school, he edited the school newspaper The Granitian while serving as president of his class. </p>
      <p>Anderson briefly enrolled at the University of Utah until, as a practicing member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, he undertook a mission through the American south in 1941. Upon his return, he volunteered for the Merchant Marine, first serving as a war correspondent in occupied China until 1945, when he was inducted into the Army, and then serving in the Quartermaster Corps and writing for Stars and Stripes newspaper. At war's end, a colleague in the Associated Press suggested he go to Washington, D.C. to inquire about a job with Drew Pearson, the investigative journalist who had written the daily "Washington Merry-Go-Round" column since 1932. Pearson hired Anderson in 1947.</p>
      <p>Anderson began covering Congress for Pearson, persuading sources to tell him what happened in closed-door meetings and to give him verbatim transcripts and government documents to support his stories. He soon came to believe that government documents were being classified and hidden from the public not for national security purposes but to protect embarrassing or even illegal activity. He intended, as he described it in his autobiography Peace, War, and Politics, "to give the people an alternative to the official version of things, a rival account of reality, a measure for judging the efficacy of rulers and whether the truth is in them." Anderson ultimately became a full partner in Pearson's column, and succeeded Pearson as its author upon his death in 1969. He would write the column daily, along with a team of reporters, until 2004. </p>
      <p>Cultivating sources who provided him with exclusive access to classified information, Anderson reported on an extraordinary range of topics and individuals in his half-century of investigative work. Topics of particular interest represented in Anderson's columns include: investigation of corruption by Senator Thomas Dodd, organized crime, the Kennedy assassination, Chappaquiddick, Watergate (Anderson published leaked grand jury testimony), U.S.-Pakistan relations during the Indo-Pakistani War (for which Anderson received the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting in 1972), fugitive Nazis, the activities of the FBI under Herbert Hoover, the white supremacist group the Liberty Lobby and other far-right organizations, the death of Howard Hughes, the ITT Corporation/Nixon Administration scandal, the ABSCAM public corruption investigation, the investigation into fugitive financier Robert Vesco, the CIA-Mafia plot to kill Fidel Castro, the Iran-Contra scandal, and the activities of innumerable Washington agencies, elected officials, and bureaucrats. For a time in 1972, Anderson was himself monitored by the CIA in the so-called "Operation Mudhen." In his columns, Anderson championed the cause of everyday Americans against the intrusions of large, sometimes corrupt institutions, motivated by the principle that (in his own words), "life is not just a struggle between evil and good but between coercion and freedom."</p>
      <p>Day by day for over 50 years, Anderson reported on activities in Washington for the benefit of those far outside of it, breaking scandals and often raising the ire of bureaucrats in order to keep the government accountable to the people. Washington Merry-Go-Round was the longest-running political column in America, appearing at its peak in more than 1,000 American newspapers and claiming 40 million readers.</p>
      <p>In addition to his daily column, Anderson maintained a high-profile presence in television, radio, and magazines, and he wrote or co-wrote 17 books, including his autobiography Peace, War, and Politics: An Eyewitness Account (1999). He had a daily syndicated radio show on the Mutual Broadcasting Network, reporting on many of the same topics that appeared in his columns. He was the Washington Bureau Chief of Parade Magazine, frequently contributing stories about Washington for a broad national audience. And he was a featured commentator on Good Morning America for nine years and hosted several television specials including Target: USA (1989) and Who Murdered JFK? (1988). To a generation of readers and viewers, Anderson was a household name.</p>
      <p>Not only a journalist, Anderson was also a crusader for causes close to his heart, founding and serving on boards of nonprofit advocacy groups promoting fiscal responsibility and educational reform. Anderson co-founded the think tank and advocacy group Citizens Against Government Waste with J. Peter Grace in 1984 in order to eliminate inefficiency and mismanagement in government. He also founded the Young Astronauts Council by persuading President Ronald Reagan in 1984 to charter an organization to motivate students to focus on math and science in school. In addition, he was among the founders of the Center for the School of the Future at Utah State University.</p>
      <p>Jack Anderson died in 2005 from complications of Parkinson's disease. He is survived by his wife, Olivia, and their nine children.</p>

      <head>Collection Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection includes articles, correspondence, index cards, book manuscripts, notes, government documents, legal documents, reports, scripts, photographs, drawings, audiovisual recordings, and artifacts that document the professional and, to a lesser extent, personal life of investigative journalist Jack Anderson. Items date from Anderson's childhood in the 1930s to 2005, the year of his death. </p>
      <p>The materials in this collection were used and produced by Jack Anderson during every stage of his writing process, from the reporter's notes, correspondence, and research materials he gathered while working on a story, to the draft and final articles he produced, to the extensive article index he and his staff maintained. The collection also documents Anderson's work as a television and radio personality, author, frequent speaker, nonprofit leader, and even occasional cartoonist.</p>
      <p>Cultivating sources who provided him with exclusive access to classified information, Anderson reported on an extraordinary range of topics and individuals in his half-century of investigative work. Topics of particular interest represented in Anderson's columns include: the investigation of corruption by Senator Thomas Dodd, organized crime, the Kennedy assassination, the CIA-Mafia plot to kill Fidel Castro, Chappaquiddick, Watergate (Anderson published leaked grand jury testimony), U.S.-Pakistan relations during the Indo-Pakistani War (for which Anderson received the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting in 1972), fugitive Nazis, the activities of the FBI under Herbert Hoover, the white supremacist group the Liberty Lobby and other far-right organizations, the death of Howard Hughes, the ITT Corporation/Nixon Administration scandal, the ABSCAM public corruption investigation, the investigation into fugitive financier Robert Vesco, the Iran-Contra scandal, and the activities of innumerable Washington agencies, elected officials, and bureaucrats.

          <p>This series contains final typescripts as well as early typed and hand-edited drafts of syndicated Merry-Go-Round columns written by Jack Anderson and his staff. Drew Pearson originated the "Washington Merry-Go-Round" column together with Robert S. Allen in 1932. Jack Anderson joined as Pearson's associate in 1947, beginning his investigative career by uncovering secrets and crusading against corruption in Congress and the Pentagon. When Pearson died in 1969, Anderson inherited the column and soon cemented his place as Washington's premier investigative reporter by winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1972. Alongside a team of reporters, Anderson wrote Merry-Go-Round columns daily until 2004. At its peak the column appeared in over 1000 American newspapers, reaching 40 million readers a day, making Merry-Go-Round the most popular and longest running political column in the nation. </p>
          <p>Merry-Go-Round columns are arranged first by type of document (typescript or article draft) and then chronologically.</p>
          <p>Typescripts are available from 1934 through 2004. Folders are arranged chronologically by the month in which the column appeared. Arrangement within each folder is not always exactly chronological. The period from 1934 to 1947 is not well represented, nor is 1959-1960. For some time periods, the collection contains "draft typescripts" that have been marked up by hand with last-minute edits. For some time periods, it also contains "typescripts for indexing" that have been marked up for the purpose of isolating key words to add the column to Anderson's extensive column index. (Kept on index cards from 1933 to 1996, the index is now Series 2 in this collection.)</p>
          <p>Hand-edited drafts are available from approximately 1950 to 2004. These were not originally labeled as Merry-Go-Round columns and were not originally marked with dates but were discovered to be column drafts based on their content. It is possible that some articles for Parade Magazine or other outlets are here because they were assumed to be Merry-Go-Round columns. Folders are arranged by decade only, and even those decades were only approximations made by the processor based on their subject matter.</p>

          <p>First kept by Drew Pearson and then painstakingly maintained by Anderson's staff, this series contains index cards that capture the names of each person, place, or thing that was the subject of a Merry-Go-Round column from 1933 to 1996. Each entry briefly summarizes the column and notes the date that the column was published. The index cards are an invaluable tool for searching Merry-Go-Round columns (Series 1) and are also very interesting on their own as documentation of the extraordinary breadth and depth of the Merry-Go-Round columns. They are arranged alphabetically. This series also includes a small "TV Index" summarizing the topics of Anderson's television broadcasts in the 1970s and 1980s (presumably on Good Morning America), and well as a small "Index of Columnists" listing which columns were prepared by each of Anderson's many staff reporters.</p>

Anderson was the author or co-author of 17 books—both nonfiction and fiction—and was the Washington Bureau Chief of Parade magazine. The material in this series is arranged first by type of material (e.g. book manuscripts, published articles, and article drafts), and then alphabetically by publication title, and finally chronologically within each title. </p>

These date from 1958 to 2005, and include the following titles: Alias Joey Cargo, Alice in Blunderland, America in Crisis, American Government…Like it Is, The Anderson File, Anderson Papers, The Ayatollah's Daughter, A Call to Action, Cambodia File, Case Against Congress, Confessions of a Muckraker, Congressmen for Sale, Control, Doomsday File, Fiasco, Good Ole Boys, Holy Mafia, How to Beat the System, I Was a Psychic Spy, Inside the NRA, The Japan Conspiracy, Kiss of Death, Kremlin, Making of a Muckraker, Millennium, The Muckrakers, Peace, War, and Politics, The Polygamists, The Saudi Connection, Stormin' Norman: An American Hero, USA: Second Class Power, Washington Expose, Washington Money-Go-Round, What's Wrong with America, Whistleblower's Manual, The White House Conspirators, and Zero Time. </p>
          <p>Published articles feature material written by Anderson for his newsletters Future File, Investigative Reporter, Jack Anderson Confidential, Personal from Pearson, and Washington Letter, as well as articles about Anderson published in newspapers and magazines. These date from 1940 to 2001. This series also includes several issues of Parade magazine containing Anderson's articles. </p>
          <p>Article drafts in this series include articles for Anderson's newsletters, Parade magazine, International Daily News, as well as statements before Congress and text and notes for speeches.

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>This series contains articles, correspondence, legal documents, government documents, notes, reports, and other textual material Jack Anderson gathered while researching his articles. They range in date from 1949 to 2004, documenting the extraordinary breadth of topics Anderson investigated during his half century of writing the "Washington Merry-Go-Round" column. While other series in this collection also contain correspondence, articles, and other materials similar to those in this series, the majority of the items in this series were intentionally gathered by Anderson and his researchers as subject files during the course of their research, and this original order has been preserved. </p>
          <p>Second in size only to Series 1: Merry-Go-Round columns, this series represents the earliest stage in Anderson's writing process, when a story idea first came to his attention or a source tipped him off to a potential story. In cases where such a source provided Anderson with classified government documents or clearly wished to remain anonymous, relevant documents have been removed and are restricted for 25 years from the date the collection was given to Gelman Library, in 2007.</p>
          <p>This series contains four subseries. Within each subseries the folders are arranged alphabetically by folder title. The largest of these is the general subseries, containing general research topics. The other three subseries contain research material on particular topics for which large amounts of research material were gathered. </p>
          <p>"Subseries 2: Thomas Dodd" contains materials Anderson and Drew Pearson gathered investigating the senator for ethics violations in the 1960s. Folders with titles beginning with asterisks have titles taken directly from Anderson and Pearson's original folders and often require some explanation. One folder in the collection, which has been called "Dodd folder titles explained," gives an outline of these titles. </p>
          <p>"Subseries 3: FBI Files," which contains FBI files of prominent individuals that Anderson obtained from sources, has been restricted in its entirety due to the potentially classified nature of its contents. </p>
          <p>"Subseries 4: Mow-Hsiang" is unusual in that it seems to have been collected not by Anderson or Pearson but by Warren Woods, a lawyer who once represented Anderson and Pearson. These materials concern Chinese military leaders Lieut. General P. T. Mow aide Colonel V. S. Hsiang, who were engaged in a legal dispute with the Chinese government under Chiang Kai-Shek in the 1950s and were represented by Woods.</p>

          <p>This series contains some items that are restricted for 25 years from the date the collection was given to Gelman Library, in 2007. Restricted items have been removed from their original files, placed in parallel files, and replaced with a separation sheet. Gelman Library will open the materials beginning in 2032, which may involve having their security classifications reviewed by appropriate government agencies.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>This series primarily contains Anderson's incoming correspondence, though there is a small quantity of outgoing correspondence. It dates from 1960 to 2004, and correspondence from the early years also includes some letters to and from Drew Pearson, Anderson's predecessor on the Merry-Go-Round column. It is arranged first by type of correspondence (e.g. reader correspondence, research correspondence, correspondence with colleagues, personal correspondence) and then chronologically.  Unless the envelopes contained unique and relevant information about letter writers, they have been removed.</p>
          <p>Reader correspondence contains letters sent by readers of the Merry-Go-Round column commenting on Anderson's writing, proposing stories, or requesting his help to call attention to their problems. (A small quantity of these letters remain unopened.) Research correspondence contains letters written to Anderson from sources and reporters regarding story ideas. Other correspondence includes: correspondence with colleagues; correspondence about Anderson's books, TV, and film projects; invitations and thank-you notes; and personal correspondence from Anderson's friends and Mormon church acquaintances. Correspondence is found elsewhere in the collection as well, when it specifically relates to corollary material and was originally found with that material. A few items have been restricted because the writer indicated a desire to remain a confidential source.</p>

          <head>Restrictions on Access</head>
          <p>This series contains some items that are restricted for 25 years from the date the collection was given to Gelman Library, in 2007. Restricted items have been removed from their original files, placed in parallel files, and replaced with a separation sheet. Gelman Library will open the materials beginning in 2032, which may involve having their security classifications reviewed by appropriate government agencies.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>This series contains scripts and proposals for television, radio, and film projects with which Anderson was associated. They date from 1969 to 1996 and are organized first by medium (e.g. television, radio, film), then by type of material (e.g. proposal, script, special) and then alphabetically by name. It does not contain audiovisual recordings; when available, they are in series 11. </p>
          <p>Anderson was a featured commentator on Good Morning America for nine years and hosted several television specials including Target: USA (1989) and Who Murdered JFK? (1988). Television programs for which scripts are available in this series include: Confessions of a Muckraker, Good Morning America, Inside Edition, Investigative Reports, The Muckrakers, Target USA, and Who Murdered JFK. They date from 1978 to 1996. There are also two folders containing scripts not labeled with a particular television program.</p>
          <p>Anderson also had a daily syndicated radio show on the Mutual Broadcasting Network. Radio programs for which scripts are available in this series include: American Family Hour, Jack Anderson Report, and Watch on Washington. They date from 1969 to 1993. Many commentaries begin with "This is Jack Anderson in Washington," so their folders have been labeled this way because it could not be determined which program they represented. There are also three folders containing scripts not labeled with a particular radio program.</p>
          <p>This series also contains several proposals and scripts for films with which Anderson was associated, some of which appear never to have been produced. Scripts are available for the following titles: The Anderson Project, Blood Feud, The Ten Plagues, and The Terrorist.</p>

          <p>This series contains correspondence, memos, reports, and legal documents relating to Jack Anderson's work with nonprofit advocacy groups, for-profit business interests, and legal cases to which he was a party. They date from 1951 to 2002 and are arranged alphabetically by organization/business name or by the name of a lawsuit. </p>
          <p>Not only a journalist, Anderson was also a crusader for causes close to his heart, founding and serving on boards of nonprofit advocacy groups promoting fiscal responsibility and educational reform. Anderson co-founded the think tank and advocacy group Citizens Against Government Waste with J. Peter Grace in 1984 in order to eliminate inefficiency and mismanagement in government. He also founded the Young Astronauts Council by persuading President Ronald Reagan in 1984 to charter an organization to motivate students to focus on math and science in school. In addition, he was among the founders of the Center for the School of the Future at Utah State University. Documents from all three organizations are included in this series, arranged first by the name of the organization and then by additional descriptors.</p>
          <p>Correspondence and memos relating to Anderson's business interests in this series include documents from companies and ventures in which he was a small shareholder as well as documents from publishers and publicists in Anderson's syndicated column and several newsletters. They are gathered together under the folder titles "Business dealings" but are not arranged in greater detail.</p>
          <p>The legal records in this series document several lawsuits to which Anderson and Drew Pearson were parties as part of their investigative work. In some cases they sued and in other cases were sued by the objects of their investigative reports. These lawsuits include:  Anderson and Pearson v. Corso, Anderson v. Nixon, Carey v. Hume and Anderson, Curtis v. Anderson, Dodd v. Pearson and Anderson, Fite v. Anderson, Liberty Lobby v. Anderson, Littrell v. Pearson, Malaxa v. Pearson, Merrill and Kramer v. Anderson et al., O'Brien v. Anderson et al., Pearson v. McCarthy, and van Deerlin v. Anderson.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>This series contains handwritten notes documenting the stories Anderson researched and the contacts he made. They are not dated. </p>
          <p>When conducting interviews, Anderson wrote his notes in what appears to be a version of Gregg shorthand, on whatever piece of paper was at hand, and as such this series contains many small slips of paper, backs of envelopes, and small notebooks on which Anderson took his notes. They are not sorted by date or topic, as they were not legible to an untrained reader, but are all simply foldered as "Reporter's notes." But although most of the text is written in shorthand, some proper names and other words on the page were written in longhand, and thus the reader can often understand the general topic of each page of notes. Also in this series are "Contacts," which consist of brief handwritten phone numbers and business cards received by Anderson. </p>
          <p>These reporter's notes and phone messages were originally found loose in boxes, separate from other identifying materials. When reporter's notes and messages were found in Anderson's own subject files, they were kept as part of the subject files and not removed to this series.</p>

          <p>This series contains a variety of drawings and punch lines for political comic strips Anderson hoped to have published in the 1990s and 2000s. Many of the cartoons featured in the series seem to have never made it past rough sketches and a few handwritten one-liners, however some do contain many copies, jokes, storyboards and correspondence. The cartoons lampoon politicians, politics, and current national events from Anderson's unique perspective as a celebrated muckraker. Anderson collaborated with many artists and writers while developing the cartoons, including Mal Hancock, a noted satirical cartoonist who is primarily associated with The National Review. </p>
          <p>The largest amount of material in the series features Anderson's modern version of Kilroy, the famous cartoon character from World War II who peered over a fence accompanied by the words "Kilroy was here." Anderson's updated Kilroy offered insights on government and the current world state of affairs. Anderson also created: "The Bellyacher Republic," which featured Kilroy-like characters interacting with each other; "Ladyship," a cartoon about a Washington socialite family; and "Doodlebugs," a cartoon featuring bug characters.</p>

          <p>This series contains video- and audiocassettes and audio reels of programs in which Anderson appeared—including six episodes of "The Insiders with Jack Anderson"—as well as programs he collected as part of his research. They date from 1969 to 2001. They are labeled with the title that originally appeared on the box or case in which they came. They are not arranged but merely grouped according to size and shape as necessary for storage.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>This series contains records that document Anderson's education, early journalistic work, military service, LDS mission, and family life. It includes correspondence, newspaper articles, notes, and military service manuals. These materials date from 1930 (a Story of the Three Bears book given to Anderson as a child) to 2000.</p>
          <p>Anderson came to his calling early, and his early journalistic work includes articles he wrote for local newspapers as an adolescent. At 12 years old, he began writing the Boy Scout column for local newspaper The Deseret News, and soon graduated to covering local news for The Murray Eagle newspaper. In high school, he edited the school newspaper The Granitian while serving as president of his class. </p>
          <p>Anderson briefly enrolled at the University of Utah until, as a practicing member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, he undertook a mission through the American south in 1941. Records from the mission are included in this series. </p>
          <p>Upon his return, he volunteered for the Merchant Marine, first serving as a war correspondent in occupied China until 1945, when he was inducted into the Army, and then serving in the Quartermaster Corps and writing for Stars and Stripes newspaper. Anderson's military manuals, documents, and copies of an Anderson article in the Stars and Stripes newspaper are also included in this series.</p>

          <p>This series consists of FBI files on Jack Anderson that were donated to Gelman Library's Special Collections Research Center by the National Security Archive. The NSA compiled them from two separate sources: first, from papers received as a result of Michael Ravnitsky's FOIA request on Jack Anderson. (Ravnitsky has made a project of filing requests on prominent people and then donating the documents to the NSA); and second, from papers that the NSA received after filing its own FOIA request on Anderson in 2005.</p>
