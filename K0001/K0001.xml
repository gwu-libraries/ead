      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Isaac Edward Kiev (1905-1975) was born in New York City to Nathan and Anna (Radin) Kiev. In 1924, Kiev entered the Jewish Institute of Religion [JIR], a new rabbinical seminary established just two years earlier by renowned Jewish leader and activist Stephen S. Wise. In 1925, Kiev began work as a page in the JIR library to help pay for school and soon he took on more responsibilities including cataloging the Hebrew manuscripts. Although Kiev did not complete his studies at the JIR, he continued to work at the library, becoming Chief Librarian in 1942, a position he held until his death in 1975. In addition to his fifty years of service at the Jewish Institute of Religion, which merged with Hebrew Union College in 1950, Kiev also served as chaplain at Sea-View Hospital, a tuberculosis sanitarium, from 1927-75. He later became a pulpit at Congregation Habonim in New York, where he served Associate Rabbi from 1966 until 1973. </p>

            <p>In a letter from Phyllis Kiev (Rabbi Kiev's daughter-in-law) to the Gelman Library dated 04/15/98, she states, "We recently had the machine cleaned and reconditioned by the Tytell Typewriter Company of New York City at a cost of over $1000, which cost Mr. Tytell at least $2000 in acquiring parts for it. Though the "K" key does not quite match the others in terms of color, this was the best that he could do under the circumstances. Tytell claims that this machine is similar to one that is currently on display in the British Museum. </p>
            <p>Following the tendency of the times for lightness and complactness in typewriting machines, the Hammond Company has condensed the features of its standard machine into a folding typewriter which has the full capacity of the large machine, taking any width of paper and carrying two sets of type, with variable spacing between the characters (Information from "Condensed History of the Writing Machine").</p>
            <p>Included are two spool covers and two articles which address the subject of Hammond typewriters. Also included is one ribbon and one semi-circular shuttle in plastic wrap (both contained in a small box).</p>
