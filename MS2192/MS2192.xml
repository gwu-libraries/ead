      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Jacob Dan Nimrod (1923-2002) was a Polish-Israeli-Canadian political commentator, active in various Zionist causes.</p>
      <p>Born in what is today the Ukraine (then part of Poland) in 1923, Dan Nimrod, originally named Ya'acov Hebel, was active in the Zionist movement from a young age. At age 15, he migrated across Europe on foot to reach what was then British Mandatory Palestine.</p>
      <p>At the outbreak of World War II, Nimrod enlisted in the British Army's Jewish Palestinian Unit and served in North Africa. He successfully defended himself against desertion charges, which arose when he joined the Irgun Zvai Leumi (National Military Organization). In 1944, Irgun began fighting British authorities for the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. At war's end, Nimrod served as Irgun's commander in several European countries, joining its general staff in 1947. He also directed the organization's public information service in Eastern Europe and worked to acquire weapons in France.</p>
      <p>On May 14, 1948, Israel officially declared its independence. Almost immediately, several surrounding Arab countries attacked. Nimrod fought in the subsequent war (1948-49) while continuing his work to supply the Jewish State with weapons from Europe. After the war ended, Nimrod served on the central committee for the Israeli nationalist party Herut (which later formed part of the Likud Party) and was an unsuccessful candidate for the Knesset (the Israeli parliament). In 1949, Nimrod married his first wife, Esther Grachanek, who later passed away from natural causes. During the early 1950s, Nimrod remained active in Israeli politics, regularly penning columns under the name Ya'acov Lotan.</p>
      <p>In 1956, Nimrod emigrated to Canada. He initially settled in Newfoundland, but later moved to Montreal. He initially served as a principal at a Jewish school but later became an independent teacher of Hebrew. Nimrod married Anita Affholter, originally from Switzerland, in 1961.</p>
      <p>Nimrod resumed his writing career anew in 1977, after his old friend, Menachem Begin, was elected prime minister of Israel. He founded the Canadian Jewish Herald, a compendium of articles relating to Israeli politics, to counter what he saw as attacks on Begin and the Likud Party in other media. </p>
      <p>Nimrod formed the self-financed Dawn Publishing Company as part of that effort in 1979. Over the next 23 years, he edited, authored, or compiled 62 books, newspapers, monographs, magazines, anthologies, position papers, and special dossiers, and corresponded with people around the world as part of his campaigns.</p>
      <p>In 2000, Nimrod donated his library of over 2,500 volumes and his extensive archives to The George Washington University. He desired to present a "different perspective" on the Arab-Israeli conflict to researchers in the capital of the United States.</p>
      <p>Nimrod died in Montreal on April 22, 2002. </p>

      <head>Collection Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection contains correspondence, publications, newspaper clippings, speeches, legal documents, photographs, audiotapes, and videotapes. The material dates from ca. 1950-2002, although the bulk is from 1977-2002. They are the papers of Jacob Dan Nimrod, largely from the time he resumed his writing career in 1977 until his death in 2002. The material in the collection covers the wide range of Nimrod's political writing activities, mainly concerning Israeli politics and foreign relations. Other prominent topics include apartheid in South Africa and the civil war in Nicaragua. It also includes the writings he saved of some of his correspondents.</p>
      <p>Nimrod's estate donated the material to The George Washington University following Nimrod's death in 2002. The correspondence is arranged by the country of the correspondent. Within each correspondence series, it is arranged in alphabetical order by individual correspondent or organization, except for general folders such as "Special Interest" and "Organizations." Within each folder, the correspondence is sorted chronologically. Nimrod's estate also included cross-references in many of the folders.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains the papers of Sol Modell, a frequent correspondent of Nimrod's and a former professor of history at Los Angeles Valley College. Upon Modell's death, his family donated the papers to Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida, where Modell had retired. The university transferred them to Nimrod, who included them with his papers donated to The George Washington University.</p>

          <p>This series contains Nimrod's correspondence with people and organizations in Canada. The bulk of the material dates from 1977-2002. Some of the material is in French. It includes Dan and Anita Nimrod's papers from their campaign to gain official recognition for Israel's Magen David Adom from the International Committee of the Red Cross. Most of the other material is Nimrod's correspondence. It also contains Nimrod's letters to the editor, open letters, "Dear Friends" letters, and "Dear Reader" letters. This series is organized by correspondent's last name or organization name, then chronologically within each folder. Folders labeled "Special Interest," "Media-General," "Media-Jewish," and "Organizations" contain multiple correspondents.</p>

This series is organized by correspondent's last name or organization name, then chronologically within each folder. The folder labeled "Special Interest" contains multiple correspondents, sorted alphabetically within that folder.</p>

          <p>This series contains Nimrod's correspondence with people and organizations in the United States. The material dates from 1956-2002. Some more prominent correspondents include Monroe Spen, a Sarasota, Florida, real estate developer who founded Friends of the Jerusalem Temple Mount Inc., and Leonard Horwin, a former U.S. diplomat and mayor of Beverly Hills, California. Horwin self-published a newsletter called Plain Talk, copies of which Nimrod collected and included in his files of correspondence with Horwin. This series is organized by correspondent's last name or organization name, then chronologically within each folder. Folders labeled "Special Interest," "Media-Jewish," "Archives - Libraries - Misc.," and "Organizations" contain multiple correspondents, sorted alphabetically within those folders.</p>

          <p>This series contains publications by Dan Nimrod and Dawn Publishing Company. It contains books, bound copies, and stapled circular correspondence. It includes some of Nimrod's early educational manuals. The material dates from 1959-2002, but the bulk is from 1977-2002. It is sorted in chronological order. Most of the material relates to the Arab-Israeli conflict, but includes other issues such as apartheid in South Africa and the Nicaraguan civil war.</p>

          <p>This series contains the papers of Professor Sol Modell (1915-98), a correspondent of Dan Nimrod's whose papers went to Florida Atlantic University and subsequently to GWU as part of Nimrod's donation. The bulk of the material dates from 1968-95. It includes letters and newspaper clippings from Modell, largely related to Israeli politics and foreign relations, but sometimes to other issues as well. Modell, a professor at Los Angeles Valley College, was a columnist for Heritage, a Jewish newspaper in Los Angeles, and wrote to many individuals, mostly in the United States.</p>
