      <head>Historical narrative</head>
      <p>The following history was prepared in 2019 by George Washington University SCRC staff with the support of the Luce Foundation.</p>
      <p>The Corcoran Archives was established in January 1980 with the assistance of grants from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission and later the National Endowment for the Humanities, a federal agency. The Corcoran Archives was established with the purpose to collect and preserve the papers which document the heritage of the largest private museum and art school in the nation's capital. The creation of the Corcoran Archives made available to the public for the first time the records of the oldest museum in Washington. </p>
      <p>In 2008, due to space reduction, most of the Archives' holdings had to be reboxed and were shipped to offsite storage. However, transfer of materials from the Corcoran's various departments to the archives continued until 2014.</p>
      <p>In the spring of 2016 the George Washington University Libraries was selected as the permanent home of the historical archives of the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the Corcoran College of Art + Design.</p>

      <p>When it was located in the Corcoran, the archives housed two "collections" that are included as series here: The Archival Audiovisual records, and the Reference vertical files. The audiovisual records include a relatively small number of videotapes and slides, but over 1,300 photographs of people, events and buildings related to the Corcoran Gallery and School throughout their histories, which were removed during processing from other record groups. The audiovisual records also contain posters of Corcoran events and exhibits. The record group also contains some unprocessed files including administrative records of the archives itself and folders needing refiling.</p>

          <p>These records are not particularly strong nor do they well document the entire span of Gallery activities. Many of the Gallery's early photographs were lost, however, some photographs of the building, portraits of Trustees and a few installation shots remain. The collection is more encompassing for the period 1950-1980. Photographs are filed in a self-indexing system which is roughly analogous to the preceding record groups. The slide collection is small, most were taken during the 1970's and consist of installation shots and educational activities. The slides are indexed in the same manner as the photographs.</p>
          <p>Posters from Gallery exhibitions are also included in this group of records. This is not a complete collection of Gallery posters.</p>
          <p>As of 1984, the Gallery had only recently begun to tape and videotape Gallery activities. Future growth in this series was expected. These records include tapes of "At the Corcoran" radio shows where staff members of the Corcoran or Gallery activities were discussed. It is probably not complete.</p>

          <p>The folders in boxes 141-146 did not transferf in 2016 with the original donation to GW. These materials came as part of a final transfer of materials in April 2022. The original containers had the label Research Files: Faculty. This labeling was added as a prefix to the folder titles which appears to match some of the other folders in this series. It is not known for certain if this record group and this series are the right location for these files, but it did appear to match the type of content. Some, but not all of these folders, also had the phrase "history files."  It is unclear if these are folders of Corcoran faculty or folders used by Corcoran faculty or a combination.</p>

          <p>This series contains objects and records transferred to GW Special Collections by the National Gallery of Art following the dispersal and disposition of the art collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art. These objects and records were initially taken by the National Gallery from the Corcoran Gallery building and arrived to GW without context of their collection arrangement or use by Corcoran staff. Additional records initially with the National Gallery were integrated into Corcoran Record Groups. This group contains objects and records that do not fit in the scope of a Corcoran Archives record group.</p>
