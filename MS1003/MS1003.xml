      <p>William Addison Paisley (c.1897-19xx) was an attorney for the Department of Justice and graduate of The George Washington University Law School in 1924. He was born in Pulaski, Tennessee. From 1913-17 he worked as a stenographer and accountant for the Southern Express Company in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. From 1917-18 he was a stenographer with the War Department in Washington and New York. During World War I, he served from 1918-19 aboard the USS Mexican, a cargo transport ship. He began his government career in 1919 with the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and continued his education by going to night school at the Washington School of Accountancy, where he prepared himself to enter law school at GW (where he was a member of the Columbian Debating Society).</p>
