      <head>Historical narrative</head>
      <p>The first section of this history, covering events through 1981, was prepared by Corcoran Archivist Katherine M. Kovocs for publication in 1985 with the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p>
      <p>The Registrar's position at the Gallery was established in 1952. The Registrar's duties included the registering of art objects; handling of loans, shipping and insurance procedures; and controlling the physical inventory and the storage of art objects. It was at this time that the Curator's and Registrar's offices, one department until this time, divided into two distinct units.</p>
      <p>The 1960s saw a continued increase in the size of the Curatorial/Registrarial staffs as well as greater expertise amongst its members. At various times throughout this decade the curatorial staff featured Chief Curators, Registrars, Curators of Exhibitions, Curator of Collections &amp; Research/Research Curator, Curator of Contemporary Art, Assistant and Associate Curators, and various curatorial and registrar assistants and secretaries.</p>
      <p>The 1970s featured further expansion, diversity, and organizational innovations in the Gallery's curatorial and registrar's departments. Until 1975, the Gallery's Director maintained an active role in curatorial affairs (e.g. exhibitions), continuing a trend begun by the Corcoran's first Curator/Director. However, with the appointment for the first time of a Chief Curator, Jane Livingston, in 1975, much of the aesthetic initiative and curatorial administrative responsibilities were placed with the Chief Curator. The Director, now aided by a large, expert curatorial staff, turned his focus toward other Gallery concerns, such as budgets, finances, and fundraising. This is especially true with the appointment of Peter Marzio as Director in 1978.</p>
      <p>The latter half of the 1970s witnessed other important occurrences such as the creation of the Associate Director's post, the naming of a Curator of Collections, and the reinstallation of the "American" (permanent) collection.</p>
      <p>Persons who figure prominently in the Registrar's Office history include Shelby Cave, Jane (McCall) Cohen, Mary (Hoffman) Porbes, Ellen Gross, Rosemary Jones, Martha Morris, Judy Riley, Glenn Thomas and Susan (Grady) Williams.</p>
      <p>The following section of this history was prepared in 2019 by George Washington University SCRC staff with the support of the Luce Foundation.</p>
      <p>Following the reinstallation of the "American" permanent collection, the Gallery continued to expand on its American art holdings, beginning to branch out into American contemporary art.
In 1979, the Gallery created the post of "Associate Curator of Contemporary Art for the Washington Region." The position was revised later to include a national focus, becoming the Associate Curator of Contemporary Art. With the appointment of Ned Rifken in 1984, the position title was changed again to Curator of Contemporary Art. </p>
      <p>Jane Livingston's tenure as the Chief Curator of the Gallery had long lasting effects on the direction of the curatorial department. From 1975 until her resignation in 1989, Livingston placed greater emphasis on photography and progressive modern art. Through her initiative, the Corcoran Gallery became a major force in Contemporary photography. Work by Ned Rifken (Curator of Contemporary Art 1984-1986) and Ed Nygren (Curator of Collections until 1988) further elevated the Corcoran's position in the Washington contemporary art scene.</p>
      <p>The Gallery suffered major setbacks in 1989 following the decision to cancel the controversial Robert Mapplethorpe retrospective The Perfect Moment. Jane Livingston resigned in protest of the cancellation, and several members of the curatorial staff followed her in departing the Corcoran. Jane Livingston's position would not be filled for another three years, until the appointment of Jack Cowart in 1992. Cowart then created the position of Curator of Photography and Media Arts in the same year.</p>
      <p>In 2007, the Corcoran set out five core subjects for the permanent collections; Historic American Art, Historic European Art, Photography and Media Arts, Decorative Arts, and Contemporary Art. There was a particular focus on the photography and American art collections. </p>
      <p>The Gallery continued to acquire art, predominantly photographs and paintings, as well as loan works and house traveling exhibitions until its partition and dissolution in 2014.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>Series 1-8 were processed by Corcoran Archivist K. Robinson in June 1983. Series 9-17 were processed in 2019 during the Luce grant project for the Corcoran Archives. Series numbering and titles from 1983 were retained, and the label "[legacy series]" indicates an original series that now has a corresponding later series with the same title. For ease of browsing, corresponding legacy and new series have been re-ordered to be adjacent in the collection display.  </p>
      <p>During original processing in 1983, the following materials were removed and placed in more appropriate locations:</p>
      <p>News clippings: Artist vertical files or history clippings files; Announcements/invitations: Special Events ephemera; Exhibition catalogs (non-Corcoran): School Library for its collection; WGMA materials: Washington Gallery of Modern Art Records; Photos/slides/transparencies/tapes: Archives Audio-Visual Records.</p>
      <p>The following materials were disposed of during original processing in 1983: Annual Report copy; employment applications, cover letters, and resumes; expense vouchers, purchase orders; miscellaneous receipts; and information queries on exhibition schedules, artists or works of art. Those queries which provided new or significant information on an exhibit, artist or work of art were retained (most often transferred to the artist vertical files).</p>

      <p>Within the Corcoran Archives, several other record groups contain related material to the Registrar's office records:</p>
      <p>RG 1.0 Corcoran Board of Trustees meeting minutes and reports -- especially those of the Works of Art Committee -- feature loan and accession information. Annual reports also contain summaries of loan and accession activities. </p>
      <p>RG 2.0 Corcoran director's records provide information regarding bequests to the Gallery. </p>
      <p>RG 5.0 Curatorial office records contains additional exhibition files.</p>
      <p>RG 5.2 Conservation department records include valuable data on individual works of art within condition reports and the quarterly reports of the Conservator.</p>

    <scopecontent id="aspace_5ff87052c513ba44127b7a9f38be7fea">
      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Registrar's Office Records contain the Corocoran Gallery's object/ accession and deaccession files, as well as additional administrative files, including records of insurance, bequests, reproduction rights, loans of works of art, and exhibitions. </p>
      <p>Much of the Registrar's Records before 1950 are bound volumes or "registers." Information on book, bronze, painting and sculpture accessions is located in four accession registers in Series 1.</p>
      <p>With the official appointment of a Registrar in the early 1950s, the records of the office become more organized and more complete than those for earlier years. The earlier "registers'' of works of art were no longer used by the late 1940s. Similar accession logbooks were used from then until the early 1960s. After that time, all accession information has been kept on accession sheets in each object file. A logbook of "X" numbers assigned lists those works found during the inventory of the collection during the late 1940s and early 1950s for which there was no notation in any of the registers.</p>
      <p>Materials containing information on all other aspects of the Office of the Registrar's activities are either greatly expanded or appear for the first time in this post-1950 period. Registrar's Reports (quarterly), which began in 1959, systematically record the activities of that department for the first time. In addition, reproduction rights and photo order requests make their first appearance in this post-1950 period, beginning in 1963. The volume of loan files expands greatly, providing an informative and complete record of loaned works of art since that time.</p>

          <p>The Record of Assignment of X Numbers (1 vol.) contains information on those works of art assigned such numbers from 1949 to 1958 (X.1 - X.262). The "X" number signifies that the source and/or date of acquisition are unknown or in doubt. It was meant as a temporary number -- to be removed once a date/source of acquisition has been identified and an accurate, permanent accession number can be assigned. The volume contains such information as date of "X" number assignment, artist name, title of work of art, and the work's final fate-- e.g. final accession number assigned, sale of the piece--and any suppositions on when the work was deposited and by whom.</p>

          <p>The series contains reports submitted by the Registrar's Office on an annual (1968-69), bi-monthly (1977-80), and quarterly (1959-72) basis. The bulk of the series is made up of quarterly reports. These contain information on accessions, attendance, docents, exhibitions, insurance claims (beginning in 1965), and loans in and out. The reports also include a special section on the Clark Collection for 1959 and a section on the Corcoran storeroom evacuation project in 1970-71, during which a thorough inventory of the collection was made. In addition, these quarterly reports, like those for the Curatorial Office, contain a Conservator's Report. The Registrar's Reports contain a conservator's section from 1959 to March 1965 and for 1969-70. Beginning in 1971, the Conservator submitted a quarterly report separate from the Registrar's.</p>
          <p>The Registrar's Annual Report for 1968-69 records information such as acquisitions, donors names, loans to other institutions, and travelling exhibitions. The report has been retained because it provides some information which is different from that found in the published Annual Report for that fiscal year.</p>
          <p>The bi-monthly reports feature information, often in statistical form, on acquisitions, insurance claims, loans, reproduction rights, and travelling shows. They appear sporadically for the years 1977-80.</p>

          <p>Materials are arranged chronologically by the year of a loan's return, then alphabetically by lender (Loans In) or receiver of the loan (Loans Out). If, in the latter case, more than one institution received the same loaned item, the institution which first received the work is considered the primary receiver and materials are filed under that institution's name.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>The series features Registrar's files on loans of works of art, both incoming and outgoing. </p>
          <p>The earliest loan information is contained in the Register of Works Received on Exhibition (2 vols.) which contains loan information from 1874-1915. The types of information include name of depositor, address, title of work of art, artist name, date of receipt of work, date installed in Gallery, and removal date. The volumes are arranged chronologically and have an alphabetical index.</p>
          <p>The bulk of series is composed of the Registrar's Office working files on loans. These contain loan information since 1901 and focus on loans after 1949. Material types include conservator's condition reports, correspondence, forwarding notices, lists of works on loan, loan forms, memoranda, and shipping receipts. Frequent lenders/ requesters for loans include the American Federation of the Arts, Art Institute of Chicago, Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Brooklyn Museum, Century Association, Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, Norton Gallery and School of Art, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Smithsonian Institution, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the White House, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Corcoran persons who figure prominently in the loan files include Shelby Cave (1976-), Susan (Grady) Williams (1973-8), Ellen Gross (1964-6), Martha Morris (1968-72), Dorothy Phillips (throughout), and Eleanor Swenson (1950-3).</p>
          <p>Researchers should be aware that the Registrar's Office loan files often contain documents on situations not normally considered "loan" circumstances, such as works of art brought into the Gallery for inspection before purchase/acceptance as a gift. This is especially true for records from the 1960s on.</p>
          <p>Finally, note that data concerning a particular loan often predates and postdates the loan period and official date of return. Therefore, a loan returned in 1957 may have material in its file from 1955 to 1958.</p>

          <p>The series contains correspondence, lists of works of art, memoranda, and reproduction rights forms concerning the Gallery's dealings with individuals and institutions requesting permission to reproduce (publish) photographs of works of art owned by the Corcoran. The most frequent requests come from publishing companies requesting photo reproduction rights for art and history textbooks. Other request sources include film companies, producers, and television stations asking for reproduction rights for films, filmstrips, and television shows.</p>
          <p>The last section of the series contains miscellaneous subjects, most often concerning lengthy publishing ventures with publishers. This section also contains the reproduction rights requests for "Media Presentations" -- films, filmstrips, and television.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>The series contains material related to the Gallery's set of Amati and Stradivari instruments which were bequeathed to the Corcoran in 1964 by Anna E. Clark. The series contains certificates of authenticity, correspondence, insurance policies, loan forms, and memoranda. The certificates of authenticity are located in two album-like books. These contain photographs of each instrument; correspondence regarding authenticity, one letter dated 1868; and the certificates, most signed by Emil Herrmann and dated from 1945-46 and 1949.</p>
          <p>Significant subjects include loans of the instrument, especially the 1965-69 loan to the Claremont Quartet (North Carolina School of the Arts); insurance for and values of the instruments; and the theft of the Amati Violin (1966) and its recovery (1971).</p>
