      <head>Historical or Biographical Note</head>
      <p>The earliest incarnation of Riggs Bank was formed in 1836 when William Wilson Corcoran opened a small brokerage house. In 1840, Corcoran and George Washington Riggs, the son of a neighbor, formed "Corcoran and Riggs", which offered checking and depositing services. The bank got a major boost in 1844, when The U.S. government assigned Corcoran and Riggs to be the only federal depository in Washington. In 1854 Corcoran retired, and the bank changed its name to "Riggs &amp; Co." After accepting a government charter, "Riggs National Bank" was born in 1896. By 1900, Riggs was twice as large as any other bank in D.C. It embarked on a successful project to become known as the bank of embassies and diplomats, and by 1950 most embassies in Washington were customers. Many branches thereafter opened within embassies in Washington D.C. and London. Riggs Bank was bought by PNC for $779 million in 2005.</p>
