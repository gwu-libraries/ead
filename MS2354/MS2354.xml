      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Woodland Normanstone is a small residential neighborhood in Northwest Washington, D.C., adjoining the larger neighborhoods of Woodley Park, Massachusetts Avenue Heights, and Observatory Circle. On March 23, 1989, the Woodland Normanstone Neighborhood Association was certified as a nonprofit corporation composed of residents of Massachusetts Avenue Heights, an area bounded by Rock Creek Park to the east, Massachusetts Avenue to the south and west, and Calvert Street, Cleveland Avenue and Woodley Road to the north. The purpose of the Association is to preserve and enhance physical and aesthetic characteristics of the Heights by encourging widely spaced residential development and the maintenance of an attractive parkline setting. </p>
      <p>In 1990 the Association was instrumental in the creation of the Tree and Slope Protection (TSP) Overlay District. The TSP was established to preserve and enhance the park-like setting of designated neighborhoods adjacent to streams or parks by regulating alteration or disturbance of terrain, destruction of trees, and ground coverage of permitted buildings and other impervious surfaces. The TSP District is designed for residential neighborhoods that are located at the edge of stream beds or public open spaces and that have a significant quantity of steep slopes, stands of mature trees, and undeveloped lots and parcels subject to potential terrain alteration and tree removal. </p>
      <p>In 1992 the Commission mapped the neighborhood represented by the Woodland Normanstone Neighborhood Association. </p>
