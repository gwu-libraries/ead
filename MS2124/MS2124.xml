      <head>Biography</head>
      <p>Dr. James G. McManaway (August 24, 1899-November 9, 1980) was an influential Shakespearean scholar.  For most of his professional life he was associated with the Folger Shakespeare Library.  From 1933 until 1943 he served as Assistant to the Director, 1943-1946 as Assistant Director and Acting Director from 1946-1948.  Finally, from 1948 until 1968 he served as Consultant in Literature and Bibliography.  During his time with the Folger, McManaway was instrumental in building the library's holdings and providing bibliographical descriptions.  McManaway served as editor of the Shakespeare Quarterly from 1951-1972. It was during McManaway's editorship that the Quarterly achieved international stature for its scholarly articles, notes and book reviews and also for additions such as the annual survey of Shakespeare in performance and an annual World Shakespeare Bibliography.</p>
      <p>Dr. McManaway received a B.A. and M.A. from the University of Virginia in 1919 and 1920 and his Ph.D from Johns Hopkins University in 1931.</p>
