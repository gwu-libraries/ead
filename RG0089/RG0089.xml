      <head>Historical or Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Chemistry has been a part of the curriculum at The George Washington University since the beginnings of the University. Located in Corcoran Hall, the Chemistry Department offers Ph.D. and M.S. programs in analytical, inorganic, organic and physical chemistry and materials science. Research fields include: combustion chemistry; polymer chemistry; theoretical chemistry; transition metal complexes; nanostructured materials; and forensic chemistry (in cooperation with the Department of Forensic Sciences). Collaborative research is also conducted with faculty from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences. </p>
      <p>GWU has had some illustrious professors of chemistry in its history. Charles Munroe (1849-1938), the inventor of smokeless gunpowder, was head of the department from 1892-98. Dr. Munroe was considered one of the world's authorities on explosives, and authored more than 100 books on that subject, as well as chemistry. Dr. Munroe served as president of the American Chemical Society and fellow of the Chemical Society of London. Domestically, he was a consultant to the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Mines. </p>
      <p>Dr. Charles Naeser taught in the department from 1935-76, and was involved with research on atomic energy (Uranium-Fluoride) in the late 1930's, and knew George Gamow and Edward Teller, theoretical physicists who were on faculty at GWU. During World War II Naeser worked on chemical warfare for the Army Chemical Center in Edgewood, Maryland. Each year, The George Washington University Department of Chemistry puts out a newsletter to staff, faculty and alumni. </p>
