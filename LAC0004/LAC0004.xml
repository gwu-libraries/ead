      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America dates its existence from October 1, 1903. On that date, a convention met to ratify the amalgamation of the Team Drivers
International Union, the Teamsters' National Union of America, and other rival groups. They assumed the name International Brotherhood of Teamsters, elected Cornelius P, Shea the first president, and established headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana. Although amalgamation officially ended the factionalism that had weakened the earlier organizations, in reality conflicts continued. In 1906, the convention split and 35 delegates joined to form a rival organization. Conditions deteriorated and in 1907, Daniel J. Tobin was elected over Shea by a majority of only twelve votes from almost 200 delegates.</p>
      <p>The Teamsters did not fade out, in spite of jurisdictional problems. Their membership gradually increased and by 1940 had reached 500,000, making the I.B.T. the largest union in the AFL, By 1952, the Teamsters claimed 1,250,000 members. This large membership also made them one of the richest unions. Their locals numbered over 900 and were located from Alaska to the Canal Zone and from Maine to Hawaii. They were independent in their activities with the International requiring the approval of contracts and by-laws and of strikes if strike benefits were to be paid and adherence to the International constitution.</p>
      <p>During these years of growth, the I.B.T.'s structure experienced several changes. Local unions remained the basic unit of organization but other bodies began to be chartered too. Whenever three or more locals existed in close proximity, they were encouraged to band together in a joint council. This council served as an arbiter of disputes and promoted cooperation in bargaining and other activities. Local unions also cooperated in state conferences and in area conferences (Central, Western, New England, etc.). In addition, trade divisions encompassing all locals engaged in a certain type of activity were organized on both a regional and national basis; the I.B.T, was a pioneer of this kind of organization.</p>
      <p>With all these structural changes, the governing offices of the union remained generally the same, Daniel J, Tobin served as General President for 45 years, 1907-1952. As I.B.T. General President, Daniel Tobin was a figure of great influence in the American labor movement. He served as AFL Treasurer, 1917-1928, and as an AFL Vicepresident, 1933-1955. He was active in Democratic Party national politics, served as delegate to several Presidential conferences and missions, and was an unofficial candidate for appointment both as Secretary of Labor and as Senator from Indiana. Within the I.B.T., he was a conscientious and well-liked leader with a salty personality. He was adamant in stating from the beginning of his tenure in office that the Teamsters would honor every contract they signed. He was also an out-spoken anti-Communist and led the I.B.T. convention of 1935 in adopting one of the first labor resolutions outlawing Communists from membership. In 1952, Daniel Tobin announced that he would retire from the General Presidency after the convention of that year. When delegates met in Los Angeles, they unanimously elected Dave Beck to the office and Tobin assumed the title President Emeritus.</p>

          <p>The staff correspondence is one of the more complete series in the collection and is especially valuable for the early years. It covers the entire range of activities of the International in its relationships with member locals, joint councils, conferences, trade divisions, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, other international unions, government agencies, and the general public. The
correspondents are (1) Daniel J. Tobin, General President; (2) Thomas Hughes and John Gillespie, General Secretary-Treasurers; and (3) Thomas Flynn, Albert Evans, and others as agents for the General President; corresponding with (l) members of the general executive board; (2) general organizers; (3) auditors; and (U) others of the International staff. </p>
          <p>Particularly notable are the files of the general organizers which frequently contain detailed reports on their activities and the problems encountered, though the files' quantity and quality varies considerably
from organizer to organizer. Letters and reports to Tobin while he was away from the office, usually written by Thomas Hughes, Thomas Flynn, or John Gillespie and filed under their names, are another rich source of
information, as are similar letters to Tobin from his secretaries, filed under the name Mary O'Neil. Also included in this series is a small amount of material concerning Tobin's personal life, his tenure as administrative
assistant to the President, and his possible appointment to the U.S. Senate, as well as some of his speeches and a few clippings about him.</p>

            <p>The local union is the basic unit of I.B.T. organization. These files are those of the I.B.T. President's office and contain exchanges of Tobin and his representatives with local union officers, business agents, and members; the joint councils and occasionally the conferences to which the locals belong; and the I.B.T. general organizers, lawyers, and Washington representatives on subjects concerning the locals. Organizing drives, contract negotiations, strikes, cases before the National Labor Relations Board and the Wage Stabilization Board, bylaws,
elections, members' complaints and problems, and many other topics are discussed. The files date mainly during the 1940 's and vary in degree of completeness.</p>

            <p>Joint councils were organized to coordinate the activities of local unions within a specific geographic area, usually a single city and its environs, though sometimes an entire state. The functions of the councils have narrowed somewhat over the years as trade divisions and conferences have assumed more and more responsibilities in the
fields of organizing and negotiation of contracts. They serve as an arbiter in disputes of member locals.
The correspondence deals with such subjects as affiliations of new locals and suspension of others, problems with local officers, political action, jurisdictional disputes, bargaining problems, difficulties with central labor bodies, and requests for statistical information. Each council is represented by only a small amount of material, most of which dates in the 1940's.</p>

            <p>These organizations were established along geographical lines for the purpose of conducting organizing and bargaining activities on a large scale. Four national area conferences exist: Central, Eastern, Southern and Western, of which the last three only are represented in the Papers. In addition, there are several smaller
area and state conferences. The files contain correspondence, minutes, and reports concerned mainly with organizing, bargaining, strikes, jurisdictional conflicts with other unions, by-laws of the conferences, financial reports, and transcripts of hearings and decisions by government agencies. Individual filee are quite fragmentary; only for the Southern Conference of Teamsters is there any appreciable amount of material.</p>

            <p>These are organizations of teamsters first established in the late 1930's on a state, regional, or national basis and along trade lines. Though some of these organizations are called "council" or "conference" rather than "trade division", they are all organized on the basis of a particular trade and thereby are differentiated from the area and state conferences. Trade divisions gradually took over much of the organizing and bargaining activity on a regional or national scale; these activities are the subject matter of the trade division files. The files include some correspondence but also considerable mimeographed and printed material such as reports, minutes of meetings, agreements, and contract summaries. The Central States Drivers Council file is quite extensive, but the majority of the trade divisions are thinly represented in the collection.</p>

            <p>This group of records consists almost entirely of exchanges between the I.B.T. and the officers of this Department and the state and local building and construction trades councils. The I.B.T. affiliated with the Department in 1928. Subsequent correspondence mainly concerns wage rates and jurisdictional disputes and includes many mimeographed reports and summaries.</p>

          <p>The general correspondence documents the I.B.T.'s relationships with the general public and non-labor organizations. Again, the great majority of material dates in the 1940's. A large segment consists of exchanges
with the United States government, mainly during World War II, and concerns both cooperative and regulative activities made necessary by the war. There are also files for several trucking and freight companies, employer associations, and many charitable organizations.</p>
