      <head>Historical or Biographical Note</head>
      <p>The George Washington University's Melvin Gelman Library opened in 1973. Before the Gelman Library (which received its current name in 1980), the University Library was located in Lisner Hall, formerly Lisner Library. When the University moved to Foggy Bottom in 1912 from its location on 15th and H Streets, N.W., the first library was located in the original Lisner Hall, the former St. Rose's School for Orphaned Girls, between 20th and 21st Streets on G Street. Other libraries include the Virginia Campus Library (established n 1990), and the Mount Vernon Campus Eckles Library (under GW control since 1997). Together, these three libraries form the Gelman Library System (GLS). </p>
      <p>The Library is headed by a University Librarian, who oversees: the Assistant University Librarian, Administration, Development, and Personnel; Associate University Librarian for Collections Services; Associate University Librarian for Information Technology; Associate University Librarian for Public Services; Directors of the Mt. Vernon and Virginia Campus libraries, and the Manager of GLS (Gelman Library System) Financial Operations. </p>
      <p>The Assistant University Librarian for Services has gone though a number of name changes and is currently known as Associate University Librarian for Information Services for Public Services, and is responsible for assuring that patrons are served well: they are able to work in a comfortable and functional building, find and evaluate the information they need with the help of a reference librarian or through computer databases, check out books, and use an up to date website. This position oversees the Head of Reference and Instruction, the Head of Circulation, the Head of Gelman Library Information Service, the Head of Media Resources, the Assistant Manager of Building Operations, and the Gelman Library Webmaster. </p>
      <p>The Associate University Librarian for Information Services for Public Services chairs meetings of the Public Services Group, made up of managers of public service operation in the library. It serves as a forum to establish service standards and coordinate provided services; synchronize priorities; and provide information impacting public services. </p>
      <p> N.B. This history note was written in 2005</p>
