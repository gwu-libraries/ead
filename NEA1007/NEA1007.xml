    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>The National Education Association (NEA) is the largest professional organization and largest labor union in the United States, representing public school teachers and other support personnel, faculty and staffers at colleges and universities, retired educators, and college students preparing to become teachers. In 2010, the NEA had 3.2 million members and is located in Washington, D.C. The group holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code granted in 1906.</p><p>The NEA describes itself as a professional employee organization. The mission of the National Education Association is "to advocate for education professionals and to unite our members and the nation to fulfill the promise of public education to prepare every student to succeed in a diverse and interdependent world."</p><p>The NEA is a volunteer-based organization that relies upon its members to perform much of the Association's work. The members are supported by staff at the local, state, and national levels with the stated goal of "building great public schools for every student."</p><p>In 1857, Thomas W. Valentine, president of the New York State Teachers Association, issued a nation-wide invitation to teachers to unite in Philadelphia behind a common voice for America's growing public school system. After the meeting, the National Teachers Association (NTA) was formed with a membership of about 100. Minority educators were allowed to join at the start, but women were not allowed to join until 1866.</p><p>In 1870, the NTA merged with the American Normal School Association, the National Association of School Superintendents, and the Central College Association renaming itself the National Education Association.  For the first 100 years of its existence, the NEA was controlled by administrators, and worked to further the interests of the "education profession" as a whole.</p><p>In the 1960's, after the first passage of a collective bargaining law for public employees, the NEA adopted union activities in addition to its operations as a professional association. </p><p>The NEA merged with the American Teachers Association (ATA), formerly the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools (NATCS) in 1966. </p><p>In 1998, a proposed merger with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) failed when it was rejected by NEA's Representative Assembly. Several NEA state affiliates have merged with their AFT counterparts, effectively forming a single association.</p><p>Over the years, the NEA has been a leader in national education reform and improvement movements. It has worked to improve the education provided to American school children through lobbying and campaigning on the local and national level as well as by promoting strong teacher education programs and continuous professional assessment and development.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Arrangement note</head>
<p>The collection is organized into roughly alphabetical series based upon the NEA's organization. Records have been allocated largely to their offices of origin and reflect the work done within the offices, departments, divisions and units. Due to the immense size of the collection and the constraints placed upon the finding aid by the archival management system utilized by George Washington University, the collection was further divided up into parts.</p><p>Organized into 9 series: American Teachers Association; Art and Exhibits; Awards; Birmingham Education Association; Joy Elmer Morgan Papers; Organizational History; Programs; Projects; State Affiliates.</p>  </arrangement>

Lee, who would go on to become the organization's first president.  By 1907, the name was changed to the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools (NATCS).  Like the NEA, the NATCS advocated in issues beyond education, such as health and housing.  In 1937, the organization changed it's name to the American Teachers Association (ATA).  The name change came, in part, to encourage inclusion of educators in less segregated parts of the country.</p><p>The Bulletin was first published in 1923.  It was the official organ of the Association and continued to operate despite the fact that the editorial staff were not paid.  This resulted in an irregular publishing schedule, but the journal operated almost continuously from 1923 until 1966.</p><p>After years of working jointly with NEA on issues related to African-American education, the ATA merged with the NEA in 1966, with all state affiliates joining shortly after.</p><p>Source: Perry, Thelma D.

He was employed by the Birmingham, Michigan public school district as a high school/junio high school history/English teacher in September, 1960.  He was on the faculty of Wylie E. Groves High School from 1960 to 1963 and then transferred to Berkshire Junior High School, serving on its faculty from 1963 to 1968.</p><p>In 1966, Dunlop became active in the Birmingham Education Association serving on a contract drafting committee, then as chairman of the local greivance committee during the 1966-1967 school year.  In 1967, he was elected president of the Birmingham Education Association serving in such capacity during a teachers' strike in the Fall of 1967.  At that time, future NEA executive director Don Cameron was employed as executive director of the Birmingham Education Association.  In addition, Walter Rogowski, future executive director of New Mexico-NEA served as vice-president of the BEA.</p><p>In 1967, Dunlop recieved a law degree from the Detroit College of Law, passed the Michigan state bar exam and was sworn in as a lawyer licensed to practice in Michigan.  At the suggestion of Don Cameron, Dunlop applied for a field services position in the NEA and was hired in August, 1968.  He was assigned to the Midwest Regional Office, where Gene Preston served as regional director and Morris Andrews served as negotiation specialist.  Both Preston and Andrews had been employed in Michigan, Preston as a local executive director and Andrews as a field representative of the Michigan Education Association.  Preston would go on to become executive director of the Pennsylvania Education Association and Andrew would go on to become executive director of the Wisconsin Education Association.</p><p>In 1970, Dunlop transferred to the Northwest Regional Office based in Seattle, Washington.  In 1971, he was appointed chief negotiator of the Hawaii State Teachers Association.  HSTA had won a representation election in early 1971 (which Dunlop took part in) and preparing to bargain a statewide collective bargaining agreement for teachers.  In 1972, the HSTA conducted a strike to bring a successful conclusion to its bargaining effort. </p><p>Dunloptransferred to NEA headquarters in 1972 to work in the Office of Negotiation, a unit of the Division of Affiliate Services.  Don Conrad was manager of the Office of Negotiation and Gary Watts was head of the Division of Affiliate Services.  In 1976, Dunlop was promoted to manager of the Office of Negotiation.</p><p>As an NEA manager from 1976 to 1985, Dunlop had responsibility for two major programs (Uniserv and Leadership Development).  He managed at the operational level, implementing programs established by NEA governance and higher administration, although he did influence policy decisions through the budget development process, being staff liaison to governance committees and making recommendations to higher adminstrators.</p><p>From 1985 to 1986, Dunlop was a staff assistant at the management level to John Hein, assistant executive director for Affiliate Services.  In 1986, Dunlop was made coordinator of NEA's Compensation Project.  In 1990 a new division was created; the Collective Bargaining and Compensation Division.  Dunlop was appointed director of the new division and had responsibility for four major programs-Compensation Project, Health Care Reform, Collective Bargaining and New Unionism.  Dunlop retired after 29 years in the NEA.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_86dfe1e82cc1ca274e8d649bc8c654b3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Series contains records created or collected by John Dunlop in his role first as a member and later as president of the Birmingham Education Association.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_d7cd8af513048310339ec2dc2d81ed6c"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Series is arranged alphabetically by title than chronologically after that.</p></arrangement><custodhist id="aspace_28ed644829efd5796288482c6cb769d5"><head>Custodial History</head><p>The records were kept by John Dunlop after he retired from the NEA.

In other cases, it means photocopies or transcriptions of original documents.  The material includes biographical material, chronologies of the organization, illustrations, flyers, historical statistics, photographs, scripts and scrapbooks.  The series also contains the records of the Centennial Committee, formed to celebrate the 1957 Centennial of the NEA, a photo album created to commemorate the inauguration of Dr. Lambert as Executive Secretary and the notes and papers of Dr. Edgar Wesley, the author of "NEA: The First Hundred Years" as well as four scrapbooks of photographs and memorabilia sent from local and state affiliates to commemorate the centennial celebration.  A fifth scrapbook seems to have been put together for the Centennial Celebration, but without the connection to the affiliates.</p></scopecontent><processinfo

The purpose of this policy was to provide a systematic procedure for adminstering project funds.  In order to meet the criteria for financial support, the project had to: assist the priorties of the NEA; be achievable within a manageable amount of time; and have a built-in evaluation system as part of its design.  Special consideration was given to projects which test new ideas or concepts or provide new approaches to old problems, as well as to projects with financial commitments outside of the NEA budget.</p><p>For more detailed backgrounds on the projects in this series, see the NEA Handbook, published annually.</p><p>Source: NEA Handbook 1974-75</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_a23b72590f218d8fd9d4682dff6a487c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Series contains materials created as part of projects sponsored by the NEA or the NEA Foundation.  The projects were often worked by or in partnership with other institutions, including member affiliates, unaffiliated education associations such as the Asociacion de Maestros de Puerto Rico, government agencies, universities,student groups, community groups and private companies such as IBM and the Carnegie Corporation.  A number of different projects are included in the series.  The prominent projects included in this series include campaigns to: push for federal tax and resource allocation reform, create a Department of Education, assess and restructure the NEA national headquarters, design an early NEA website, integrate technology into education, standardize job descriptions for educators, erect affordable housing for educators and retired educators, show the comparable inequity of educator salaries to similar careers, lower the voting age, and studies of crime and violence among student-age populations.</p><p>These projects cover a variety of topics, some of which are go beyond education, providing great insight into the NEA's work in diverse areas of American public life, including legislative and judicial campaigns on behalf of both educators and students as well as the changes brought to both the organization and to educators in general by technological changes of the late 20th century.</p><p>The files include action plans, affiliate histories, agendas, brochures, comic books, correspondence, 5 ¼ inch floppy disks, housing blueprints, marketing products, memos, minutes, pamphlets, project strategies, proposals, reports and surveys.</p></scopecontent><separatedmaterial id="aspace_8abd12703e92f1204ee0ad8d8f0065e6"><head>Separated Materials Note</head><p>Some materials were separated for size.

John Dunlop</head><p>John Dunlop graduated from Michigan State University in 1959 with a degree in history.  He was employed by the Birmingham, Michigan public school district as a high school/junio high school history/English teacher in September, 1960.  He was on the faculty of Wylie E. Groves High School from 1960 to 1963 and then transferred to Berkshire Junior High School, serving on its faculty from 1963 to 1968.</p><p>In 1966, Dunlop became active in the Birmingham Education Association serving on a contract drafting committee, then as chairman of the local greivance committee during the 1966-1967 school year.  In 1967, he was elected president of the Birmingham Education Association serving in such capacity during a teachers' strike in the Fall of 1967.  At that time, future NEA executive director Don Cameron was employed as executive director of the Birmingham Education Association.  In addition, Walter Rogowski, future executive director of New Mexico-NEA served as vice-president of the BEA.</p><p>In 1967, Dunlop recieved a law degree from the Detroit College of Law, passed the Michigan state bar exam and was sworn in as a lawyer licensed to practice in Michigan.  At the suggestion of Don Cameron, Dunlop applied for a field services position in the NEA and was hired in August, 1968.  He was assigned to the Midwest Regional Office, where Gene Preston served as regional director and Morris Andrews served as negotiation specialist.  Both Preston and Andrews had been employed in Michigan, Preston as a local executive director and Andrews as a field representative of the Michigan Education Association.  Preston would go on to become executive director of the Pennsylvania Education Association and Andrew would go on to become executive director of the Wisconsin Education Association.</p><p>In 1970, Dunlop transferred to the Northwest Regional Office based in Seattle, Washington.  In 1971, he was appointed chief negotiator of the Hawaii State Teachers Association.  HSTA had won a representation election in early 1971 (which Dunlop took part in) and preparing to bargain a statewide collective bargaining agreement for teachers.  In 1972, the HSTA conducted a strike to bring a successful conclusion to its bargaining effort. </p><p>Dunloptransferred to NEA headquarters in 1972 to work in the Office of Negotiation, a unit of the Division of Affiliate Services.  Don Conrad was manager of the Office of Negotiation and Gary Watts was head of the Division of Affiliate Services.  In 1976, Dunlop was promoted to manager of the Office of Negotiation.</p><p>As an NEA manager from 1976 to 1985, Dunlop had responsibility for two major programs (Uniserv and Leadership Development).  He managed at the operational level, implementing programs established by NEA governance and higher administration, although he did influence policy decisions through the budget development process, being staff liaison to governance committees and making recommendations to higher adminstrators.</p><p>From 1985 to 1986, Dunlop was a staff assistant at the management level to John Hein, assistant executive director for Affiliate Services.  In 1986, Dunlop was made coordinator of NEA's Compensation Project.  In 1990 a new division was created; the Collective Bargaining and Compensation Division.  Dunlop was appointed director of the new division and had responsibility for four major programs-Compensation Project, Health Care Reform, Collective Bargaining and New Unionism.

In addition to regular salary increases, the staff received guarantees of grievance arbitration and more vacation time. Retired N.E.A. staff, however, did not receive any benefits. In a July, 1971 report to the NEA retirees, Dick Kennan, director of the Professional Rights and Responsibilities unit, noted "Few people are still at NEA who sacrificed to build the organization, who worked for very low salaries and who went on half-pay for many months:  so we elders have little voice to win interest in fair treatment."
In November 8, 1971, the first NEARO meeting was held. Attendees included Sam Lambert, Don Morrison, Dale Robinson, John Starie, Lyle Ashby, Elizabeth Berckman, Charles Bish, Ivan Booker, Lee Boyer, Helen Campbell, Poppy Christian, Lois Clark (Michigan), Bertha Cornell, Louise Crown, Eva Cummins, Edwin Davis, Agnes Dalboe, Hazel Davis, Howard Dawson, Thelma Dietz, Robert Eaves, Lucille Ellison, Wilda Faust (Florida), Elizabeth Geib, Ernest Giddings, Laura Heintel and Frank Hubbard.
It was only in 1985 that NEARO successfully won a cost of living adjustment for its members. In 1989, an automatic, annual pension increase was promised. These and other gains came from the work of the many volunteers who have taken an active role in the organization over the years. The list of presidents over the years includes: Ivan Booker, Charles Bish, Lois Rogers, Merrill Hartshorn, Margaret Stevenson, Sylvia Brotman, T. Marcus Gillespie, Anna Hyer, Dave Darland, Alice Cummings, Marty Ware, Byron Spice, Norma Plater, Dick Mallory, Bill Dresser, Dorothy Massie and current president Hazel Blakey.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_747bcc06bf4f8af7776448bbbb55236a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Series contains one newsletter donated by members of

Devision reached the same conclusion...it was time to bring PR directors together from around the country.</p><p>State association editors had been meeting for several years, but until 1969, PR people had not been providede the opportunity to assemble as a group. A decision was reached to bring together those who listed public relations coordination as part of their job assignment.</p><p>The site for the first gathering was New Orleans, Louisiana. Here on January 15-17, 1969, the Public Relations Council was born.</p><p>Staff members from 44 states met at the Bourbon Orleans Hotel in the French Quarter. Theme of the meeting was "NEA - State Public Relations to Strengthen Locals."</p><p>There was a diverse mix of staff in attendance: editors, business managers, public relations directors, and state convention coordinators. NEA paid the full travel cost for the participants.</p><p>Following the conference, a summary booklet was printed which put the seminar issues into a public relations practitioner's resource phamplet: "What is the State Association PR job?"</p><p>In 1970, the group reassembled in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.
