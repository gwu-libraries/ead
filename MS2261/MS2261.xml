      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Emilie Margaret White was an alumna and supporter of George Washington University, as well as a nationally recognized foreign language teacher and administrator in the District of Columbia Public Schools.</p>
      <p>Ms. White was raised in Washington, DC, and was educated in Washington public schools.  She graduated in 1907 from George Washington University with a bachelor's degree, and later also received a master's degree from GWU.</p>
      <p>Ms. White taught German and Latin in the DC public school system for many years, and also served as the director of foreign languages for the school system.  She authored a two volume German textbook that was used in the DC public school system and elsewhere.  She also served as a member of the joint committee of the National Education Association (NEA) and the Modern Language Association to set up a program for gifted students, and was the first honorary member of the Department of Foreign Languages of the NEA.  </p>
      <p>Ms. White was a strong supporter of George Washington University.  She created the Abigail Ann Brown White and Henry Kirk White Scholarship Fund in memory of her parents, and specified that graduates of DC public schools be given preference for the scholarship.  She also served as president of the alumnae group Columbian Women, and received an Alumni Achievement Award in 1965 from the university and an Alumni Service Award in 1969 from the General Alumni Association.</p>
