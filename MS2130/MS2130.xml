            <p>George Nordlinger (1897-1994) was a member of The George Washington University community for over three quarters of a century, as a student, faculty member and emeritus professor. A life-long Washington, D.C. resident, he was born there April 30, 1897. He graduated from Western High School, and from GW with an A.B. degree in 1918. From the time he was a small boy he wanted to be a doctor, and went on to Medical School at GW, receiving his M.D. in 1922. Three years later, after doing work in hospitals in the U.S., Dublin and Vienna, he returned to begin what would be a thirty-seven year faculty appointment teaching obstetrics and gynecology. He was fondly known as \Uncle George\ to students who took his courses, including the first courses on birth control offered by the School in 1930. </p>
            <p>While on the faculty, Dr. Nordlinger also maintained a private OB/GYN practice, delivering more than 7,500 babies during the course of an active professional life. The Medical School's Class of 1949 dedicated their yearbook to him, noting that he had been "unanimously selected as the Godfather of the Class, in appreciation of the many watchful hours he has spent before and during the delivery of our sons and daughters. We shall always be grateful for his kind assistance as our instructor, obstetrician, and friend." </p>
            <p>Dr. Nordlinger retired from the faculty in 1962, and from private practice in 1969, but remained a frequent visitor to the GW campus, even taking history classes in his late eighties, saying that as an undergraduate and medical student he was so focused on the sciences there was "no chance to learn the liberal arts." Reflecting in a 1987 interview on the changes his profession has seen, he marveled at the advances in knowledge brought to the field. Yet he lamented that the art of medicine seemed to be on the decline. Instead, "What we have today is a group of highly-trained, efficient scientist with developed dexterity that are using ancillary materials, such as instruments and machines, far above their senses. The result is scientists who sell their knowledge and skill to customers who are buying care for their bodies." Doctors know very little in this day and age of going into the home to care for a patient. Dr. Nordlinger was a founder and past president of the Jacobi Society, member of the Washington Gynecological Society, and a member of the Society of the Emeriti of GW. His brother Bernard I. Nordlinger (B.A. 1929, J.D. 1933) won a Distinguished Alumni Award from GW in 1965. He and his wife Rosalie were married for fifty-four years, and had a daughter, Joan, born in 1932. Dr. Nordlinger died January 4, 1994 in Washington, D.C. </p>
            <p>This item was donated to the University Archives by Dr. Nordlinger's daughter Joan Nordlinger in 2003. An oral history was done with Dr. Nordlinger in 1991, and can be found in MS0371, the Oral History Collection. Formerly ACC#1052. </p>

            <p>Part of accession 2011.057. Henry Herbert Reeves played football and baseball at GW in the mid-1930s.  He was a teacher and coach in Arkansas before enlisting in the Air Force and becoming a pilot.  During World War II he served as an instructor of pilots.  He retired after 31 years in the Air Force as a full Colonel.  He died in 2007 at the age of 92.  During his junior year at GW, Reeves was bit by a dog that was possibly rabid.  He was given the nickname "Mad Dog" by his teammates. Cartoonist James Berryman drew this cartoon about Reeves and made reference to his Mad Dog nickname.</p>

            <p>Edward Bagby (1842-1864). In 1860-61 Edward Bagby was in his Junior year at Columbian College. In the spring of 1861, likely after Virginia's secession in April, several students moved to place a Confederate flag atop the College Building's cupola. Edward Bagby, age 19, from King and Queen County, Virginia, tried to convince his fellow southerners (perhaps even his own nephew, only 1 year younger, who was also a Junior) that this action would be imprudent. Failing that, he escorted President Samson to the cupola to remove it. The respect students gave him apparently helped protect the president from any harassment during this little crisis. Edward then left college to join the Virginia 36th Infantry, Company K. He was killed at the Battle of the Crater, outside Petersburg, July 30, 1864.</p>

            <head>General note</head>
            <p>George Nordlinger (1897-1994) was a member of The George Washington University community for over three quarters of a century, as a student, faculty member and emeritus professor. A life-long Washington, D.C. resident, he was born there April 30, 1897. He graduated from Western High School, and from GW with an A.B. degree in 1918. From the time he was a small boy he wanted to be a doctor, and went on to Medical School at GW, receiving his M.D. in 1922. Three years later, after doing work in hospitals in the U.S., Dublin and Vienna, he returned to begin what would be a thirty-seven year faculty appointment teaching obstetrics and gynecology. He was fondly known as \Uncle George\ to students who took his courses, including the first courses on birth control offered by the School in 1930. </p>
            <p>While on the faculty, Dr. Nordlinger also maintained a private OB/GYN practice, delivering more than 7,500 babies during the course of an active professional life. The Medical School's Class of 1949 dedicated their yearbook to him, noting that he had been "unanimously selected as the Godfather of the Class, in appreciation of the many watchful hours he has spent before and during the delivery of our sons and daughters. We shall always be grateful for his kind assistance as our instructor, obstetrician, and friend." </p>
            <p>Dr. Nordlinger retired from the faculty in 1962, and from private practice in 1969, but remained a frequent visitor to the GW campus, even taking history classes in his late eighties, saying that as an undergraduate and medical student he was so focused on the sciences there was "no chance to learn the liberal arts." Reflecting in a 1987 interview on the changes his profession has seen, he marveled at the advances in knowledge brought to the field. Yet he lamented that the art of medicine seemed to be on the decline. Instead, "What we have today is a group of highly-trained, efficient scientist with developed dexterity that are using ancillary materials, such as instruments and machines, far above their senses. The result is scientists who sell their knowledge and skill to customers who are buying care for their bodies." Doctors know very little in this day and age of going into the home to care for a patient. Dr. Nordlinger was a founder and past president of the Jacobi Society, member of the Washington Gynecological Society, and a member of the Society of the Emeriti of GW. His brother Bernard I. Nordlinger (B.A. 1929, J.D. 1933) won a Distinguished Alumni Award from GW in 1965. He and his wife Rosalie were married for fifty-four years, and had a daughter, Joan, born in 1932. Dr. Nordlinger died January 4, 1994 in Washington, D.C. </p>
            <p>This item was donated to the University Archives by Dr. Nordlinger's daughter Joan Nordlinger in 2003. An oral history was done with Dr. Nordlinger in 1991, and can be found in MS0371, the Oral History Collection. Formerly ACC#1052. </p>

            <p>Thomas Dawes Eliot (1808-70) was born in Boston, Massachusetts, March 20, 1808, and died in New Bedford, Massachusetts, June 12, 1870. He earned an A.B. in 1825 and an A.M. in 1829 from Columbian College (the first name of what became The George Washington University in 1904). He studied law in Washington and New Bedford, and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar. </p>
            <p>After being a member of both houses of the legislature, he was elected to Congress as a Whig, to fill the unexpired term of Zeno Scudder, serving from April 17, 1854 to March 3, 1855, and making an eloquent speech on the Kansas Nebraska bill, which was published (Washington, 1854). He was prominent in the Free-soil convention at Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1855, and on the dissolution of the Whig party was active among the founders of the Republican Party in Massachusetts. He declined its nomination for attorney general in 1857, but was afterward elected to Congress again for five successive terms, serving from 1859-69. Mr. Eliot took an active part in the proceedings of the house, particularly in the legislation on the protection and well-being of African-Americans. </p>
            <p> Materials in this collection include a journal Elliot kept while a student at Columbian College and includes notes on lectures given by college President William Staughton, and Elliot's own orations. It ranges in date from 1823-24. The provenance of this journal is unknown, it was discovered in a box of back log material and accessioned in Aug. 2001. Formerly ACC#1010. </p>

            <p>Paper entitled "Back to the U.S.S.R" (1976) by Sondra Claudine Langtry (M.A. 1974). Sondra Claudine Langtry (1944-1982) spent four months traveling in the Soviet Union in 1976. She spent time in Odessa and Kiev relaying information about what she encountered in terms of living conditions and people she interacted with both in the government and on the street. Langtry's journal of this time "Back to the USSR" recounts her many experiences during this time in her life. During her trip she assisted her father in locating some of the relatives he had not spoken to since his departure from Russia in 1920. Langtry received her M.A. in Russian Literature from The George Washington University in 1974. She also received degrees from the University of Texas at Austin and American University. She died in 1982.</p>

            <p>Contains two articles by Paul Cooke in the "Journal of Negro Education," 1956 and 1958 that detail desegregation in all D.C. colleges and universities.</p>
            <p>Andrew J. Novak (1983- ) was a student at George Washington University when he donated this collection to the library in 2004. He was the Historical Research editor for the student newspaper "The Hatchet" for the 2003-04 academic year, and majored in International Relations at the Elliott School of International Relations. He also worked as a student assistant in the University Archives in 2004-05. Mr. Novak's interest in the history of the university in general, and former president Cloyd Heck Marvin (1927-59) in particular, led him to research and write a book titled "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit: A Critical Portrait of Cloyd Heck Marvin. " The book was self-published by WORDPRO Press in Ithaca, New York in 2004. </p>
            <p>Marvin's term in office was marred by almost constant friction with liberal elements of the student body and alumni, and his disputes with the faculty boiled over into protest several times and nearly led to an investigation by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). The AAUP never investigated his term at George Washington, though they were appealed to do so many times; they did conduct an investigation of his administration at Arizona, however, and were quite critical of Marvin's lack of respect for faculty tenure and academic freedom.</p>

            <p>Contains a copy of Elizabeth Lathrop's (Division of Library Science) appeal to the AAUP in 1936. [Also see Elmer Louis Kayser's oral interview on Alfred Schmidt, University Librarian and head of Division of Library Science in former ACC#239.]</p>
            <p>Andrew J. Novak (1983- ) was a student at George Washington University when he donated this collection to the library in 2004. He was the Historical Research editor for the student newspaper "The Hatchet" for the 2003-04 academic year, and majored in International Relations at the Elliott School of International Relations. He also worked as a student assistant in the University Archives in 2004-05. Mr. Novak's interest in the history of the university in general, and former president Cloyd Heck Marvin (1927-59) in particular, led him to research and write a book titled "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit: A Critical Portrait of Cloyd Heck Marvin. " The book was self-published by WORDPRO Press in Ithaca, New York in 2004. </p>
            <p>Marvin's term in office was marred by almost constant friction with liberal elements of the student body and alumni, and his disputes with the faculty boiled over into protest several times and nearly led to an investigation by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). The AAUP never investigated his term at George Washington, though they were appealed to do so many times; they did conduct an investigation of his administration at Arizona, however, and were quite critical of Marvin's lack of respect for faculty tenure and academic freedom.</p>

            <p>Contains a copy of Andrew Novak's book on Marvin, 2004. Copyright law governs commercial use of the book. </p>
            <p>Andrew J. Novak (1983- ) was a student at George Washington University when he donated this collection to the library in 2004. He was the Historical Research editor for the student newspaper "The Hatchet" for the 2003-04 academic year, and majored in International Relations at the Elliott School of International Relations. He also worked as a student assistant in the University Archives in 2004-05. Mr. Novak's interest in the history of the university in general, and former president Cloyd Heck Marvin (1927-59) in particular, led him to research and write a book titled "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit: A Critical Portrait of Cloyd Heck Marvin. " The book was self-published by WORDPRO Press in Ithaca, New York in 2004. </p>
            <p>Marvin's term in office was marred by almost constant friction with liberal elements of the student body and alumni, and his disputes with the faculty boiled over into protest several times and nearly led to an investigation by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). The AAUP never investigated his term at George Washington, though they were appealed to do so many times; they did conduct an investigation of his administration at Arizona, however, and were quite critical of Marvin's lack of respect for faculty tenure and academic freedom.</p>

            <p>George Nordlinger (1897-1994) was a member of The George Washington University community for over three quarters of a century, as a student, faculty member and emeritus professor. A life-long Washington, D.C. resident, he was born there April 30, 1897. He graduated from Western High School, and from GW with an A.B. degree in 1918. From the time he was a small boy he wanted to be a doctor, and went on to Medical School at GW, receiving his M.D. in 1922. Three years later, after doing work in hospitals in the U.S., Dublin and Vienna, he returned to begin what would be a thirty-seven year faculty appointment teaching obstetrics and gynecology. He was fondly known as \Uncle George\ to students who took his courses, including the first courses on birth control offered by the School in 1930. </p>
            <p>While on the faculty, Dr. Nordlinger also maintained a private OB/GYN practice, delivering more than 7,500 babies during the course of an active professional life. The Medical School's Class of 1949 dedicated their yearbook to him, noting that he had been "unanimously selected as the Godfather of the Class, in appreciation of the many watchful hours he has spent before and during the delivery of our sons and daughters. We shall always be grateful for his kind assistance as our instructor, obstetrician, and friend." </p>
            <p>Dr. Nordlinger retired from the faculty in 1962, and from private practice in 1969, but remained a frequent visitor to the GW campus, even taking history classes in his late eighties, saying that as an undergraduate and medical student he was so focused on the sciences there was "no chance to learn the liberal arts." Reflecting in a 1987 interview on the changes his profession has seen, he marveled at the advances in knowledge brought to the field. Yet he lamented that the art of medicine seemed to be on the decline. Instead, "What we have today is a group of highly-trained, efficient scientist with developed dexterity that are using ancillary materials, such as instruments and machines, far above their senses. The result is scientists who sell their knowledge and skill to customers who are buying care for their bodies." Doctors know very little in this day and age of going into the home to care for a patient. Dr. Nordlinger was a founder and past president of the Jacobi Society, member of the Washington Gynecological Society, and a member of the Society of the Emeriti of GW. His brother Bernard I. Nordlinger (B.A. 1929, J.D. 1933) won a Distinguished Alumni Award from GW in 1965. He and his wife Rosalie were married for fifty-four years, and had a daughter, Joan, born in 1932. Dr. Nordlinger died January 4, 1994 in Washington, D.C. </p>

            <head>General note</head>
            <p>Black leather medical bag from Dr. George Nordlinger. George Nordlinger (1897-1994) was a member of The George Washington University community for over three quarters of a century, as a student, faculty member and emeritus professor. A life-long Washington, D.C. resident, he was born there April 30, 1897. He graduated from Western High School, and from GW with an A.B. degree in 1918. From the time he was a small boy he wanted to be a doctor, and went on to Medical School at GW, receiving his M.D. in 1922. Three years later, after doing work in hospitals in the U.S., Dublin and Vienna, he returned to begin what would be a thirty-seven year faculty appointment teaching obstetrics and gynecology. He was fondly known as \Uncle George\ to students who took his courses, including the first courses on birth control offered by the School in 1930. </p>
            <p>While on the faculty, Dr. Nordlinger also maintained a private OB/GYN practice, delivering more than 7,500 babies during the course of an active professional life. The Medical School's Class of 1949 dedicated their yearbook to him, noting that he had been "unanimously selected as the Godfather of the Class, in appreciation of the many watchful hours he has spent before and during the delivery of our sons and daughters. We shall always be grateful for his kind assistance as our instructor, obstetrician, and friend." </p>
            <p>Dr. Nordlinger retired from the faculty in 1962, and from private practice in 1969, but remained a frequent visitor to the GW campus, even taking history classes in his late eighties, saying that as an undergraduate and medical student he was so focused on the sciences there was "no chance to learn the liberal arts." Reflecting in a 1987 interview on the changes his profession has seen, he marveled at the advances in knowledge brought to the field. Yet he lamented that the art of medicine seemed to be on the decline. Instead, "What we have today is a group of highly-trained, efficient scientist with developed dexterity that are using ancillary materials, such as instruments and machines, far above their senses. The result is scientists who sell their knowledge and skill to customers who are buying care for their bodies." Doctors know very little in this day and age of going into the home to care for a patient. Dr. Nordlinger was a founder and past president of the Jacobi Society, member of the Washington Gynecological Society, and a member of the Society of the Emeriti of GW. His brother Bernard I. Nordlinger (B.A. 1929, J.D. 1933) won a Distinguished Alumni Award from GW in 1965. He and his wife Rosalie were married for fifty-four years, and had a daughter, Joan, born in 1932. Dr. Nordlinger died January 4, 1994 in Washington, D.C. </p>
            <p>This item was donated to the University Archives by the Dean of the Medical School in 2000. Note also that Dr. Nordlinger's daughter Joan donated his cap and gown, diploma, and other certificates in 2003. An oral history was done with Dr. Nordlinger in 1991, and can be found in MS0371, the Oral History Collection. Formerly ACC#810.</p>
