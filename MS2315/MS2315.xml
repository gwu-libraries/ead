      <p>Norman R. Tamarkin (1939-1999) was a prominent Washington, DC, psychiatrist and national expert on political psychology. Dr. Tamarkin graduated from Ohio State Medical School. After completing psychiatric training at Illinois State Psychiatric Institute in 1968, he came to the Washington area to do research at the National Institute of Mental Health. He ran the drug addiction program at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Washington after which he entered private practice. During the more than 25 years that Dr. Tamarkin practiced psychiatry, he gained a reputation for his ability to help prominent political and entertainment figures deal with their many stresses. Dr. Tamarkin died in January 1999. This biography was excerpted from the NYTimes obituary. http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/11/classified/paid-notice-deaths-tamarkin-norman-r.html.</p>
      <p>According to the donor, Mr. Rosenbaum, Dr. Tamarkin commissioned the footage and Mr. Rosenbaum became the recipient from Dr. Tamarkin, but any project associated with the footage did not happen.</p>

          <head>General</head>
          <p>The film contains footage that is most likely a march in Washington D.C. on November 15, 1969. There is additional footage of what appear to be protest speeches and other protest looking activities. The audio quality is poor and at times hard to discern.  The donor described this as roll B footage.</p>
